#### Words of advice
In open source, I think the learning happens when you go through the code & try to understand
how it works, learn a thing or two from patterns & the way code is written.
For any feature you might be working on, I'll advice just run the app, put debugger points in chrome
& go step by step to understand how it works.
Happy contributing ! :)
